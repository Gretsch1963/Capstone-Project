Publisher: John Hickman
Date:  November 2023

## Introduction
US housing values have accelerated at paces that has priced many homebuyers out of the market. In addition, incomes have risen on average at a slower annual pace and mortgage interest rates are the highest seen in a generation. According to Urban Institute, homebuyer affordability is at an all-time low. This project examined the inputs into housing affordability for US homebuyers, examining 22 years of housing values and attempts to use data analytics capabilities of MS Excel to predict where homeowner affordability is going based on the housing values, wages and mortgage interest rates.
